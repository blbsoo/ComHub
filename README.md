Comhub

- Project Overview

Introducing Comhub - a platform conceptually designed for comedians to find gigs, connect with fellow comedians, for organizers to find comedians, and for audiences to explore comedy gigs! Comhub started as an idea for a "comedian-organizer matching app" and has evolved into a comprehensive platform where comedians can connect, improve their art, and organizers can find talent.

- Current Status
This project is currently under development. Here is a breakdown of the ongoing tasks:

- Front-End Development: Currently working on designing and implementing the user interface.
- Database Setup: Planning and structuring the database to manage users, events, and interactions.
- Back-End Development: Will focus on creating the server-side logic and API integrations after completing the database setup.
