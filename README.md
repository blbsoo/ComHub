# Comhub (read me in progress)

## Project Overview

Comhub is a platform designed for comedians to find gigs, connect with fellow comedians, and for organizers to discover comedic talent. Additionally, it provides a space for audiences to explore comedy gigs. What started as a simple "comedian-organizer matching app" has evolved into a comprehensive platform aiming to improve the comedic community.

## Motivation

Existing platforms like GigGag and OpenComedy lack user-friendliness and fail to offer a well-rounded community space and personalized, easy-to-build portfolios. Comhub aims to fill these gaps with user-friendly features and a more comprehensive approach to connecting comedians, organizers, and audiences.

## Personal Note

I'm working on this project as a personal portfolio endeavor, driven by my passion for creating and viewing software and web development as forms of art. This project is not for commercial or personal gain but to showcase my skills in UI/UX design and front-end development. While the landing page model is ready, I'm currently working on the back-end and the rest of the development.
